# Boston-Crime-Analysis-and-Predictions

## Introduction

The Boston Police Department's Crime Incident Reports are official records that document all incidents the department responds to. The reports contain comprehensive and concise descriptions of each incident, including the type, location, and time of occurrence. These reports are essential for law enforcement, community organizations, and researchers to analyze crime trends, allocate resources, and make informed decisions. The dataset, consisting of over 600,000 records and 17 columns, provides a valuable resource for understanding crime patterns and enhancing public safety in Boston and surrounding areas.
Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of a shooting incident occurring in future cases based on historical crime incident data. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to identify patterns and relationships between various factors, such as location, time of day, and incident type, to build an accurate predictive model. The model will be tested and validated using real-world data to ensure its effectiveness in reflecting shooting incident trends in the Boston area.

## Key Questions

Throughout this project, we will address the following questions:

    * Common Crime Types and High-Risk Areas: Identify the most common type of crime and areas that experience them, requiring increased police attention and resource allocation.

    * Year with the Highest Crime Incidents: Determine the year with the highest number of crimes.

    * Crime Trend Analysis: Analyze changes in crime trends in high-crime rate areas over the past few years (day, month, quarter, and year-wise). Determine the most common time for crimes to occur.

    * Frequent Crimes in Each Area: Identify the most frequent crime in each area.

    * Frequency of Offense Types Leading to Shootings: Examine the frequency of different offense types leading to shootings, especially in gang hotspots.

    * Crime Pattern on Weekends vs. Weekdays: Compare crime patterns between weekends and weekdays.

    * Criticality Evaluation: Evaluate the criticality of crimes based on different areas and times, creating a derived column on a scale of 1 to 5.

    * Resource Allocation Using Heatmaps: Allocate resources (police, hospitals, traffic controllers) based on the criticality of crimes, using heatmaps.

    * Safe and Tourist-Friendly Neighborhoods: Identify safe and friendly neighborhoods for tourists.

    * Correlation with Various Factors: Investigate correlations between crime rates and factors such as weather (winter, spring, summer, fall), population, holiday seasons (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Independence Day, National Holiday Calendar), etc.

    * Most Common Time of Day for Crimes: Determine the most common time of day for crimes to occur.
